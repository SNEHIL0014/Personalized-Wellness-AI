# 🧠 Personalized Wellness AI

This project is a machine learning proof-of-concept that predicts mood based on synthetic wellness data. It simulates realistic health behaviors—like daily steps, sleep duration, stress levels, and dietary intake—and uses a Random Forest model to deliver actionable wellness insights.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 📊 Synthetic data generation with real-world logic
- 📈 Data visualizations (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- 🤖 Mood prediction using Random Forest Regression
- 🧪 Model evaluation using RMSE and R² metrics
- 🔐 Ethical design with privacy and fairness considerations
